# codeclimate-action

A GitHub action that publishes your code coverage to [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com/).

## Usage
This action requires that you set the [`CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID`](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/configuring-test-coverage) environment variable. You can find it under Repo Settings in your Code Climate project.

The default coverage command is `yarn coverage`. You can change it by setting the `coverageCommand` input value.

### Example

```yaml
steps:
- name: Test & publish code coverage
  uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@master
  env:
    CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: <code_climate_reporter_id>
  with:
    coverageCommand: npm run coverage
```
